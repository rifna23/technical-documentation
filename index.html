                        There are many languages about coding.In this page,we provide you some information about them.The languages that you will find in this page are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTML</li>
                            <li>CSS</li>
                            <li>Python</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>You can explore other languages of your own.Just have fun and learn.</p>

            <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

                    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
                        You can add new looks to your old HTML documents.
                        You can completely change the look of your website with only a few changes in CSS code.
                        Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process. For example: If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will be become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. It was a W3C recommendation.
                        CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.
                        CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.

                    <p>Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.
                        Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.

                        The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP sockets). Look at the table of contents for The Python Standard Library to get an idea of what’s available. A wide variety of third-party extensions are also available. Consult the Python Package Index to find packages of interest to you.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>There are probably millions of users, though it’s difficult to obtain an exact count.
                        Python is available for free download, so there are no sales figures, and it’s available from many different sites and packaged with many Linux distributions, so download statistics don’t tell the whole story either. 
                        The comp.lang.python newsgroup is very active, but not all Python users post to the group or even read it.</p>
